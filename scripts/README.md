## 🛠️ How It Works

### File Structure Explanation:

1. **index.html**: Main structure containing all sections
2. **styles/main.css**: Core styling, layout, and animations
3. **styles/components.css**: Interactive components and hover effects
4. **styles/responsive.css**: Mobile breakpoints and responsive design
5. **scripts/main.js**: All JavaScript functionality including navigation, animations, and mobile menu

### Key JavaScript Functions:

- `initNavigation()`: Handles smooth scrolling and active link updates
- `initMobileMenu()`: Mobile hamburger menu functionality with black background
- `initScrollEffects()`: Intersection Observer for fade-in animations
- `initAnimations()`: Controls glow effects and card hover animations
- `initBackToTop()`: Floating back-to-top button

### CSS Architecture:

- **Mobile-first**: Responsive breakpoints starting from 480px
- **CSS Grid**: Used for flexible layouts (skills, tools, projects)
- **Flexbox**: Navigation and card layouts
- **CSS Custom Properties**: Consistent color scheme
- **Animations**: Keyframes for glow, fade, and float effects
